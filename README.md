GeoNote
===========

GeoNote is a quick little application which let's you save notes tagged with a GPS coordinate.
This app was mostly made for fun, and to test some of the concepts in Ember.js

Currently, this app uses:
- Ember.js magic for all the application routing, data-binding, and application logic
- Local Storage for saving the notes
- Offline mode (you might want to use this offline someday!)

Thanks to the Ember team and all their hard work on making an awesome framework, and a supportive community. If you haven't checked Ember.js out yet, you should!
